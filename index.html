                        People tried the usual approaches first, iterating and
                        adding, but this turned out to be far too slow.
                        Eventually, they tried pre-computing, or "currying," if
                        you want to use some slightly gate-keeping terminology.

                    The Data Export Is SLOW!
                    <aside class="notes">
                        "It's slow" is one of those interesting challenges in
                        computing. You just never know where it will lead.<br/>

                        It turned out that *printing integers to stdout* was
                        taking significant time in these exports. The code
                        looked hauntingly familiar. It had a loop, and what
                        turned out to be some expensive operations in it,
                        including a division.

                    Decimal Digits
                    <aside class="notes">
                        We'd love to know how long the decimal representation
                        will be. It turns out, this can be slimmed down.<br/>

                        The binary representation of an unsigned integer has a
                        most significant 1. This can be in 32 (or 64, but in any
                        case a small number) of possible places. Each of those
                        places represents a range of numbers that has at most
                        two different numbers of decimal digits. For example, a
                        number with its leftmost 1 at position 4 represents
                        numbers from 8--1 decimal digit--to 15--2 decimal
                        digits.

                    Offset Table (One Size Bigger)
                    <aside class="notes">
                        We use a CLZ instruction to find where that significant
                        1 is. We add a magick number from the table. That magick
                        number is guaranteed to be larger than the original
                        integer size, but it has a special property. When
                        we look at just the bits beyond the width of the original
                        number, we get the number of decimal digits in the
                        original number.
